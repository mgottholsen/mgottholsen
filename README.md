### Hello!


As a senior leader in innovation, I have developed a unique perspective through my background in data, health, and government. My extensive experience in driving strategic outcomes through emerging technologies, digital services & analytics, and design thinking has equipped me with the skills needed to tackle complex challenges.

In my current role as a digital strategy advisor at Humana, I am responsible for driving innovation within the Enterprise Analytics group. My focus is on enhancing the end-user experience and data mesh transformation for advanced disruptive technologies such as our self-service analytics tools, machine learning platform, data products, and digital health platform. I am also actively involved in advancing digital inclusion and equity initiatives, which have proven critical in promoting connectivity and digital skills among under-served populations.

Prior to joining Humana, I served as a government innovation & technology representative for five years, leading and supporting award-winning and innovative projects such as LouisvilleKy.gov, Louisville's Open Data portal & catalog, and indoor navigation technology for the blind & visually impaired. These accomplishments required a high level of leadership, creativity, and innovation.

Overall, my experience as a senior leader in innovation has given me the ability to develop and execute strategies that drive transformational change. I am confident that my skills in driving innovation, coupled with my extensive experience in data, health, and government, make me an asset to any team looking to stay at the forefront of their industry.
